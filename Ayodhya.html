Ram mandir is the inception of the awaking of indigenous civilization and the milestone for Hindu struggle. 


India's 500-year-old civilisational struggle for reclaiming Ram Janmabhumi ended with Prime Minister Narendra Modi performing Bhoomi pujan for the construction of Grand Ram Mandir in Ayodhya on August 5th, 2020.

Ram Janmabhumi Mandir at Ayodhya will be built by the "Shilpis" and "Sthapatis" of Sompura caste of Gujarat. Sompura sthapatis are well versed in ancient Maru Gurjarat sthapatya Shaili of western India. It is only surviving variant of ancient Nagara architectural tradition of North India.
As such new temple will be much closer in look to the original one destroyed by Babur. The Architect of Ram Mandir, Ayodhya, Shri Chandrakant Sompura 77ys old, comes from a family of temple architects from Ahmedabad.
The original design was prepared by Sompura ji in 1889.He was asked to design
 Ram Mandir by Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) President Ashok Singhal ji 30 yrs ago. In 1989 nobody was allowed to the site & there was strict security.
He had accompained by Singhal ji to the site with no equipment, he used his feet to measure the dimensions of the site.
Now the temple project is handled by his sons Nikhil and Ashish under his guidance. The family has designed more than 200 such great temples including  Somnath temple, Akhshardham, Birla Mandir Kolkata.

The Ram Mandir will retain its original plan of "Nagara Style" of temple design but the size will be double now. 
Construction of the temple after waiting five centuries, in Ayodhya Ram birth place is the beginning of a new era,
"Ram Rajya is Coming". Ram mandir will be the manifestation of divinity and grandeur. It would not only be a religious place but also a place which depicts the great history, sacrifice and culture to the whole world.


Ayodhya Ram Mandir will be The Modern Symbol of Our Tradition and also the symbol of unity and peace.</p></div></div><div class="columns">
                            <div class="column" id='section2'><div class="head"><span class="headline hl3">ayodhya ram birth place</span></div><p>Ram birth place is also known as Ram janmabhoomi. This place is known to be the birthplace of Lord Ram, Ram believed to be the seventh author of Vishnu. No one knows that when Ram was born some says Ram is timeless and some says Ram was born 7,000 years ago in the pre-bronze age which is stone age as per historical but for me it was a period of a fabulous Indian culture one that the world's archeologist have yet to discover. Until they do it remains a matter of faith we do not get any information of Ram from Vedas or Upnishad. Our earliest source of  the Valmiki Ramayan. Ram story slightly different from Valmiki is narrative is told by sages of Pandavas in the Mahabharata to confirming that Ram lived long before Krishna but when exactly no one is still sure about when lord Rama was born Hindu believe that lord Rama was actually born in Ayodhya. Ayodhya is regarded as one of the seven sacred cities of the Hindus. The Ramayana says that the location of Rama's birthplace is on the banks of the "Sarayu River" in a city called Ayodhya. Great Indian epic poem Ramayana tells about the birth of Rama and with the rule of his father, Dasharatha. The town was prosperous and well fortified and had a large population. 


Hindus in India claim that the exact site of Rama's birthplace is where the Babri Masjid once stood in the present-day Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh. According to this theory, the Mugals demolished a Hindu temple that marked the spot, and constructed a mosque in its place. People opposed to this theory state that such claims arose only in the 18th century, and that there is no evidence for the spot being the birthplace of Rama.

The political, historical and socio-religious debate over the history and location of the Babri Mosque, and whether a previous temple was demolished or modified to create it, is known as the Ayodhya dispute.

In 1992, the demolition of the Babri Mashid triggered Hindu nationalist increased the Hindu-Muslim violence.

Still there are so many places, in other parts of India, Afghanistan, and Nepal, claims to be as birthplaces of Rama.

On the case of Ayodhya their are five judges Supreme Court heard the dispute cases from August to October 2019. On 9 November 2019, the Supreme Court ordered the land to be handed over to a trust to build the Hindu temple. It also ordered to the government to give alternate 5 acre land to Sunni Waqf Board to build the mosque. On 5 February 2020, the trust known as Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra was created by the Government of India. The trust will oversee the construction of the Ram Mandir. The foundation stone for construction of the temple was laid on 5 August 2020 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.</p></div></div><div class="columns">
                            <div class="column" id='section3'><div class="head"><span class="headline hl3">ayodhya importance</span></div><p>The legendary city of Ayodhya is the birthplace of Lord Rama,  setting an epic of Ramyana. It is regarded as one of the seven most important pilgrimage sites for Hindus. Ayodhya was stated to be the capital of the ancient Kosala kingdom in the Ramayana. Thus, it was also referred to as "Kosala". 
The word "Ayodhya" is  formed from  derivation of the Sanskrit verb 'yudh' which means "to fight, to wage war". The initial 'a' is the negative prefix: the whole, therefore, means "not to be fought". Saketa" is the older name for the city. The Adi Purana states that Ayodhya is called Saketa "because of its magnificent buildings which had significant banners as their arms". 


Ayodhya has a humid subtropical climate, typical of central India. As of the 2011 India census, Ayodhya had a population of 55,890. Males constituted 56.7% of the population and females 43.3%. Ayodhya had an average literacy rate of 78.1%.


The mythical place that came to be identified with the present-day Ayodhya only during the Gupta period around the 4th-5th century AD. In 1992, it lead to the demolition of Babri masjid mosque by Hindu mobs with the aim to replace it with a temple of Rama. 


It is believed that the birth spot of Rama was marked by a temple, which is said to have been demolished by the orders of the Mughal emperor Babur and a disputed mosque erected in its place. The Ayodhya dispute concerns activism by Hindu groups to rebuild a grand temple of Rama at the site of Janmabhoomi. The five judges of the Supreme Court bench heard the title dispute cases from August to October 2019. On 9 November 2019, the Supreme Court, headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi, vacated the previous decision and ruled that the land belonged to the government per tax records. It further ordered the land to be handed over to a trust to build the Hindu temple. It also ordered the government to give alternate 5 acre land to Sunni Waqf Board to build the mosque.


The early Buddhist and Jain clerical texts mention that the religious leaders Gautama Buddha and Mahavira visited and lived in the city. The Jain texts also describe it as the birthplace of five tirthankaras namely, Rishabhanatha, Ajitanatha, Abhinandananatha, Sumatinath and Anantnath, and associate it with the legendary chakravartins. From the Gupta period onwards, several sources mention Ayodhya and Saketa as the name of the same city.
 
For the proposed Ram temple in Ram Janmabhoomi, the Bhoomi Pooja and the Foundation Stone laying were performed by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 5th August, 2020. Ayodhya was beautifully decorated and illuminated by the residents with earthen lamps on that auspicious day.</p></div></div><div class="columns">
                            <div class="column" id='section4'><div class="head"><span class="headline hl3">ayodhya august 5</span></div><p>The date 5 August, obviously  is very important for the Hindus as the historical Bhoomi Pujan was organised for Ram Temple on that very day. With the Ram mandir to be built in the next three years,  that is why Bhoomi Pujan was necessary inspite of the ongoing pandemic. Also, the day became more special with the arrival of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Ayodhya for the auspicious Bhoomi Pujan. 


On August 5, the much awaited Bhoomi Pujan for the Ayodhya temple was attended by Bharatiya Janata Party and Sangh parivar leaders including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, Governor Anandiben Patel, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat, Baba Ramdev, BJP national vice-president Uma Bharti and Ram temple trust president Nritya Gopal Das. The last two are facing trial for their role in the 1992 demolition of the Babri Masjid.


The Bhoomi Pujan was a "grand, symbolic" affair and broadcasted through TV all over the country. A special Diwali was celebrated in Ayodhya  to mark the event, illuminated with earthen lamps and colourful lights. While only about 200 guests present at the foundation laying programme, the trust has ordered for 100,000 packets of prasad for distribution among devotees. The trust's general secretary, Champat Rai, has appealed to the people not to come to Ayodhya in large numbers on August 5, as there are curbs due to the pandemic. He said a grand programme would be held once the covid crisis is over.


August 5 also happens to be the anniversary of the Modi government's other landmark decision of virtual abrogation of Article 370 in J&K. August 5, 2020 marks the final demise of an old political consensus and the beginning of a new journey for the nation, the contours of which have been worked upon by the Sangh for decades now.</p></div></div><div class="columns">

Prime Minister Narendra Modi graced the occasion and participated in the ceremony before laying the first brick for the soon-to-be constructed Ram Mandir. 

Scared soil from more than 2000 "Teerth Sthan" and water from more than 100 rivers has been brought to Ayodhya for Bhoomi Pujan. Prime Minister Narendra Modi unveils a plaque to mark the laying of Foundation Stone; Also releases Commemorative Postage Stamp on "Shree Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir".

Bhoomi Pujan is done to invoke Bhoo Devi, Vastu devata (Deity of all the directions), and the Panchbhootas (the five elements) through the vedic mantras, it is done in the honour, worship and respect to Bhumi devi, as well as to take her permission. This pooja assures the safety and smooth functioning with the removal of the obstacles that may occur during the time of construction and to bring peace, prosperity and also to restore the positive energy of land by removing all the negative energies from environment. 
The 'bhoomi pujan' function at Ayodhya done by the Prime Minister of India televised globally by the national broadcaster. Over 160 million people watched the live telecast of the bhoomi pujan, which broke all records.  Thousands of devotees lit earthern lamps in their home to celebrate the ground breaking ceremony of Ayodhya's Ram Temple. The VHP activists beat the trumpets and distributed ‘prasadam’ and sweets to celebrate the occasion. The first prasad from Bhoomi Pujan of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, has been given to a Dalit family. They were given prasad along with a copy of Shri Ramcharitmanas & Tulsi mala. It was only after that the distribution of prasad for others began in Ayodhya.

Ramalayams across the State were decked up for the occasion. 
While most of the country rejoiced  the auspicious day  and "Jai Siya Ram" being chanted and displayed across the world.

A digital billboard of Ram Mandir also came up in New York’s Times Square.</p></div></div><div class="columns">

The belief came into currency since 1813–14, when the East India Company's surveyor Francis Buchanan reported that he found an inscription on the mosque walls which attested to this fact. He also recorded the local tradition, which believed that emperor Aurangzeb (1658–1707) built the mosque after demolishing a temple dedicated to Rama.


The mosque there, the Babri Masjid, was destroyed during a political rally which turned into a riot on 6 December 1992 case was lodged in the Allahabad High Court, the verdict of which was pronounced on 30 September 2010. In the judgment, the three judges of the Allahabad High Court ruled that the 2.77 acres (1.12 ha) of Ayodhya land be divided into three parts, 1/3rd will be allotted for mandir, 1/3rd for the mosque and the remaining 1/3rd for the akhara performance and practice by the Hindu.


Five judges Supreme Court bench heard the dispute cases for a quiet a time period from August to October 2019. On 9 November 2019, the Supreme Court, headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi, announced the verdict of the apex court; it voided the previous decision and it further ordered the land to be handed over to a trust to build the Hindu temple. It also ordered the government to give an alternate five-acre of land to the Sunni Waqf Board to build the mosque.


The case was given to K.Parasaran a 92 year old advocate who is a now regarded as God's advocate. The initial construction work started on 5th of August with the Bhumi pujan which was performed by prime minister of India Narendra Modi.</p></div></div><div class="columns">

There are plans to build a Ramayan circuit by the river Saryu that passes through the town. It was announced on the occasion of "Deepotsav" on Diwali eve. Moreover, the airport will be named after Lord Ram.


The Uttar Pradesh government has announced a number of development and beautification projects in the temple town, with a budget of more than Rs 500 crore.  The proposed airport in Uttar Pradesh's Ayodhya has received Rs 500 crore allocation from the state government in the UP Budget 2020. This comes after the state government initiated discussions with the central government to set up an airport in Ayodhya. Also in UP Budget 2019, the state government allocated Rs 200 crore for the proposed airport. In November 2019, Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri informed Parliament that the Airports Authority of India (AAI) has received a proposal from the Uttar Pradesh state government that it would develop the existing airstrip through State construction and designed services (UP Jal Board). The proposed airport in Ayodhya will be built under the Modi government's flagship scheme regional connectivity scheme (RCS)- Ude Desh ka Aam Naagrik (UDAN).


The advance planning includes not only a new airport and railway station, but also an upgrade of the nearby highway and local tourist spots. As of now, Ayodhya has an airstrip for the use of VIPs. But the government has announced that it will be converted into an airport. Not much has happened since the announcement made two years ago. The government is still in the process of land acquisition.  


There are plans to promote Ayodhya as a big religious tourism destination. The government is expecting huge stride by 2024, when the awaited Ram temple is expected to be completed.</p></div></div><div class="columns">

On 5 July 2005, five terrorists attacked the makeshift Ram temple at the site of destroyed Babri Mosque in Ayodhya, India. All five died in the gunfight with the Central Reserved Police Force (CRPF), while one civilian died in the grenade attack which was done by the attackers launched in order to blowout the cordoned wall. The CRPF suffered three casualties, two of whom were seriously injured with multiple gunshot wounds. This was all started from,





In 1992 Babri Madjid was attacked by heavily armed terrorists. The attack was failed by security officials and the attackers were killed.


The terrorists belongs from the Islamic terrorist organisation Lashkar-e-Taiba, and they have enter India through Nepal. They posed as pilgrim on their way to Ayodhya, and boarded a Tata Sumo at Akbarpur near the Kichaucha village in Faizabad. At Faizabad they changed the Sumo and hired a jeep driven by a driver Rehan Alam Amsari. According to a statement by the driver, the terrorists visited the Ram Temple at Ayodhya where they prayed, possibly to reinforce the impression that they were in reality pilgrims. The terrorists then drove the jeep into the Ram Janmabhoomisite, and forced the driver out of the vehicle, banging the jeep against the security cordon. At 9:05 am, they thrown M67 grenades from 50 metres away to breach the cordon fence. Ramesh Pandey, a pilgrim guide who happened to be near the site at this moment, died on the spot as a result of the grenade blast. Firing indiscriminately, the 5 terrorists entered the Mata Sita Rasoi. Returning the gunfire, a platoon of 35 CRPF soldiers killed all five of the terrorists in a gunfight that lasted for over an hour. Three CRPF soldiers also received serious injuries and, as of July 2008, two remain comatose. All the terrorists died within 100 metres of the site.




The Supreme Court, headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi, announced their decision, it vacated the previous decision and ruled that the land belonged to the government based on tax records. It further ordered the land to be handed over to a trust to build the Hindu temple. It also ordered the government to give an alternate five-acre tract of land to the Sunni Waqf Board to build the mosque. After that on 5 February 2020, the Government of India made the announcement for the trust named as Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra.
