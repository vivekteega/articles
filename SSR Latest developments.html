He used to go there, often with his girlfriend, Rhea Chakraborty, and other friends too. The first time when he came to the Pavna farmhouse, it was Rhea's birthday. A puja was held on the occasion followed by a party in the evening. Rhea's parents and brother also attended the puja and the party. Moreover, the last time Sushant  visited the Pavna farmhouse, he was not accompanied by Rhea Chakraborty. Rather he came with Siddharth Pithani, his associate Neeraj, his cook Keshav and one more person. Sushant was not well and therefore he took a little rest there. Later, they went for boating.


The manager of the farmhouse informed that before the lockdown announced in March, Sushant wanted to do farming at the farmhouse. The manager said, "He wanted to come here for farming before lockdown. The plan was to stay here for 2-3 months. On March 14-15, before the first lockdown was announced, he gave me a list of farming equipment and other things to buy. He also sent a vehicle full of ration for 2-3 months. But when his plan was cancelled, all the stuff was returned. "He added, Rhea would always accompany Sushant every time he would visit Pavna. Her family came here 3-4 times. The locals have also confirmed about the parties that used to happen at the farmhouse. The report further adds that Sushant had paid his rent dues in advance till August 2020.

All  his close ones and family members are being questioned for the case. Vishal Kirti,  Sushant's brother-in-law was also investigated. Vishal Kriti recently slammed the media where an article called  "toxic Bihari families" for putting pressure on their male children. Vishal said he is responding to the article as it affected not only his ‘loved ones but people from Bihar in general’. 


The articles talk about the dynamic of Indian culture that how parents expect their male child to be an ideal child for them “I wanted to let it go since, despite the tragedy in the family, I have to work just like many of Sushant’s other family members and after a long work-week, I was reluctant about addressing these issues,” Vishal Kirti wrote in a blog post. “But decided otherwise since I found out that this was affecting not only my loved ones but people from Bihar in general.”

Vishal also dismissed that Bihari families can’t stand girlfriends. “Many people know that Sushant dated Ankita Lokhande for at least six years and they lived together for a good portion of that relationship. People have seen great pictures of Ankita and Sushant’s family together and almost everyone knows that some members of Sushant’s family, including my wife, are in constant touch with Ankita,”. He also wrote that even though Sushant never explicitly admitted to dating actor Kriti Sanon, he, Vishal, had met her and was very fond of her as well.</p></div></div><div class="columns">

The central bureau of investigation on 6Aug registered a case against actor Rhea Chakraborty and others in connection with the death of actor sushant Singh rajput on recommendation of the Bihar government.  The Enforcement Directorate on Friday questioned Rhea Chakraborty, her brother Showik, her CA Ritesh Shah and her former manager Shruti Modi for over eight to nine hours in connection with the money laundering probe involving the death of Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput.

Rhea was the first to arrive at the ED office in Mumbai along with her brother.

Rhea chakraborty, speaking to ED, denied allegations that she siphoned off any money from Sushant Singh rajput. She said she paid for everything from her own income.

                            <div class="column" id='section7'><div class="head"><span class="headline hl3">Sushant Singh Rajput Mumbai police</span></div><p>Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput committed suicide in Mumbai on June 14. Sushant's sudden demise left his family, friends, colleagues, fan everyone seemed to mourn his loss very deeply. No one can still believe that Sushant Singh Rajput can commit suicide. The Mumbai police commanded an investigation on the suicide case. A team of three doctors conducted an autopsy and submitted their postmortem report to Bandra police and they mentioned the cause of death was due to Asphyxia due to hanging. But after a long wait of 1month when the family didn't get any satisfactory results they handover the case to Bihar government on Friday.


Rajput's father KK Singh on Wednesday filed an FIR in Patna the father said he will not be able to go to Mumbai to fight the case due to his health issues. KK Singh raised some serious allegations on Rajput's current girlfriend and actor Rhea Chakraborty accusing her for forcing Rajput to commit suicide by harassing him. The Bihar police case was registered under various IPC section including 341 (wrong restraint), 342 (wrong confinement), 380 (theft in dwelling house), 406 (criminal breach of trust), 420 (cheating) and 306 (abetment of suicide).


After Sushant Singh Rajput's lawyer's argument in the Supreme Court hearing, Centre is putting forward their arguments. Solicitor General of India, SG Mehta talks about the investigation as there is no sanctity of 56 statements recorded by Mumbai Police. Mehta says, "The exercise that Mumbai police are undergoing is without an FIR. No report of the inquest has been filed before the district or sub-divisional magistrate. A basic report on apparent causes of death showing bruises, marks, wounds, or fractures should be before Magistrate. They even said that Mumbai Police never began an investigation, rather they were doing an 'inquest', which is a judicial inquiry to ascertain the facts in relation to the death case. Centre further demands a free and fair probe into the case. It further asserted that the truth in the SSR case must come out and the Maharashtra government has given out a foregone conclusion and called it a case of suicide. He further questions that where is the report of injuries marks on the body and reports of bruises on th body. He says, "Now what is an investigation? We need to see who is the petitioner. Is she an accused or not involved at all. Here there is no case pending in Mumbai ... when police files a report or chargesheet under section 173 a Magistrate orders arrest of those involved." "Investigation as per the Criminal Procedure Code is going on in Bihar as there is no such Investigation in Mumbai", he added.

The deputy chief minister from Bihar Sushil Kumar Modi on Friday accused the Mumbai police for not cooperating the state investigators. Maharashtra minister Jayant Patil however backing up for  Mumbai police saying they will solve the case soon.</p></div></div><div class="columns">

Siddharth Pithani, one among the four in the house was during Sushant's death. He was Sushant's flatmate from April 2019 to June 2020. Besides, he was Sushant's creative content manager. He came into notice after his mail which was sent to Mumbai police stating that, he was forced by Sushant's family to give statement against Rhea Chakraborty. 


 Along with Rhea Chakraborty's family, Siddharth was also called for inquiry in the ED office. Siddharth was seen on 10th and even on 11th of August in the ED office. He was interrogated for 14 long hours on 11th August which ended at 2 am. On that day, he spent his whole night in the ED office as no hotels were available due to lockdown, as per the sources. 


According to the sources, these were the questions asked to Siddharth during the interrogation:
-Income for past five years also income tax returns.
-If Sushant paid him any salary? If yes, details of Pithani's bank statements starting from January 2020?
-If Sushant directly transferred the money in Pithani's bank account?
-If Pithani was aware of the two companies that Sushant had set up in 2019-20?
-If Pithani ever met Varun, co-director of a company that Sushant had set up called Innsaei Ventures in 2018?
-If Pithani handled the finances of Sushant or Rhea ?
-If Pithani is aware of properties purchased by Chakraborty's?
-If any work was outsourced to any other firm?
-If the company was working on some developments in VR arena since one of the projects was developing Virtual Reality content under the banner Vividrage RhealtyX.


In recent days,  Sushant's father and his family has given a 9 page long emotional statement. In which he wrote "Siddarth was very helpful and supportive after Sushant's death, but no sooner as FIR was filed against Rhea he started supporting her and went against Sushant's family."
